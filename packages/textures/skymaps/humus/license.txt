My name is Emil Persson, but I'm mostly known as "Humus", which has been my
nickname for as long as I've had one. I'm currently working as a graphics
programmer at Avalanche Studios in Stockholm. Previously I've been working in
ISV relations at ATI / AMD. My main interests are graphics and photography.

The particular files named "powerlines"

... are from under some powerlines south of the 407 expressway. You can see
the AMD building (formerly ATI) on the powerlines_lf face, left of the trees.
