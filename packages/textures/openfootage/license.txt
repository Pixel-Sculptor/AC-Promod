ADDITIONAL CLAUSES:
	(As mentioned on: http://www.openfootage.net/?page_id=4)

Can I use the footage for commercial works?
	Yes you can, all the footage is realeased under the creative commons copyright, giving you
	the rights to use for commercial, non-commercial, remixes or whatever you want.
	The only exception is, you are not allowed to re-sell or redistribute the textures
	on other footage sites or collections.

So you give up all your copyrights?
	The only thing I want from you is that you write my site www.openfootage.net in the credits of your work.

So why do you do that, what's your advantage?
	I will create this footage for my work anyway and there is no real reason that I should keep them for
	myself and I like the idea of sharing footage to get new works done with the same feedstock.
