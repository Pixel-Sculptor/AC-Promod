SPECIAL NOTES:
   Use the "skin.jpg" file in this folder if you wish to make derivative playermodel 
   skins for personal use, as this file is the original (though optimised) skin file.

   Please read http://assault.cubers.net/docs/playerskins.html before editing a skin for
   personal use to find out how best to implement your new playermodel skin in-game.
